The provided script is a part of the study titled "Improving Above Ground Biomass Estimation in Tropical Indian Forests" which has been submitted to "Ecological Informatics".

The script focuses on developing Height-Diameter (HD) models using field inventory data and comparing these models with existing Global H-D models.

After generating H-D models, tree heights are predicted using the tree diameter measured on the field. Then, the plot level biomass is estimated using various allometic models (FSI VOlume equation, and Pan Tropical models by Chave et al., 2014). 

Sample data sets are provided along with the script. Data are given in the zip file named "Data.zip" for HD modeling and plot Biomass Estimation

Use the script "Script_India_Biomass_HD_Model.R" for HD model and AGB Estimation. Codes "TreeBiomass.R" & "PlotBiomass.R"  will enable tree and plot biomass estimation using the Forest Survey of India (FSI) Volume equation. "Volume_Equations_Database_FSI.csv" file contains the volume equation database.
